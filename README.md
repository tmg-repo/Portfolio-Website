## Getting started

Simply visit tmgportfolio.netlify.app to check it out.

## Project description

I created a web portfolio that showcases a bit about me, my skills I have/ am working on as a developer and scientist, as well as personal projects I have created and will continue to add. It also allows me to connect to people who visit my portfolio.

## Building tools

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build my web portfolio.

## What I learnt

I learnt some web development skills I haven't worked on in a while, specifically more skills using the functions of CSS. It was great to see what can be made too, with HTML, CSS and JavaScript too after working with React for a while.
